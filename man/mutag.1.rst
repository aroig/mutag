SYNOPOSIS
=========
| paur [COMMAND] [OPTION] TARGETS...

DESCRIPTION
===========
paur is an interface to pacman, AUR, and local user package repositories,
written in python. paur stands for Pacman, Aur and User as uniform Repositories.

HOW IT WORKS
============
paur recognizes three sources of packages:
1. User: PKGBUILD's stored in a local directory.
2. Arch repositories: as configured in /etc/pacman.conf
3. AUR: obtained via the AUR http API.

The repositories have an intrinsic priority order. By default the priorities go
as listed above. That is, if the same package appears in a User repository, and
in Arch, the User one is chosen. This priority order may be overriden with the
configuration variable repoorder.

As a general rule, it is preferable to keep packages in User with a unique name,
just to avoid confusion. However, let's say I mantain a package bla-git in
AUR. Then it makes sense to keep the development of bla-git in User with the
same name, an even use paur to upload the PKGBUILD to AUR.
